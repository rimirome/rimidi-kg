# n8n Workflows

Automation assets that orchestrate Skye, Sunny, and Luna.

## Structure
- `workflows/` - exported n8n JSON workflows and node templates.

## Key Assumptions
- Production automation runs inside n8n; this repo only stores exports and documentation.
- Skye must run first to normalize input before Sunny is invoked.
- Sunny and Luna nodes should receive the alias summary generated by Skye for auditability.
- Secrets (Neo4j credentials, GitHub tokens, Slack webhooks) are injected via the n8n runtime and never committed here.
