# Validation Summary
- Category, ownership, and provenance fields are now standardized across all node and relationship definitions (`schema/node_types.yaml:6`, `schema/relationships.yaml:6`).
- Status values comply with the `active|planned|deprecated` vocabulary, and default provenance fields point to the current release (`schema/node_types.yaml:8`).
- New governance relationships (`CONFIGURED_FOR`, `USES`) and the extended `DELIVERS`/`SUPPORTS` semantics align product workflows with CRM lineage (`schema/relationships.yaml:558`).

## Schema Completeness
- Every node definition includes `category`, `owner_team`, `status`, and fixed provenance metadata along with dual-plane visibility and attribute references (`schema/node_types.yaml:6`).
- Relationship definitions provide the same governance fields and cover the additional shared CRM links requested, including ImplementationVariant support (`schema/relationships.yaml:558`).
- Required/optional attribute references were updated to use `attributes.governance.owner_team` and document expected provenance defaults (`schema/attributes.yaml:5`).

## Ontology Alignment
- `docs/ontology.md` regenerates tables with the normalized fields, adds the `ImplementationVariant` node, and documents the new relationships without placeholder TODOs (`docs/ontology.md:1`).
- Sunny/Luna context cards reference the refreshed nodes and edges, including `CONFIGURED_FOR`, `USES`, and workflow/client `SUPPORTS` semantics (`ai/context/product.md:1`, `ai/context/platform_architecture.md:1`, `ai/context/shared_crm.md:1`).
- No deprecated entities from prior ontology versions remain.

## Logical Checks
- Product lineage now traces UseCase outcomes from both capabilities and workflows via the expanded `DELIVERS` relationship (`schema/relationships.yaml:92`).
- CRM lineage links ImplementationVariant→Client (`CONFIGURED_FOR`) and Client→ProductCapability (`USES`), satisfying the requested cross-plane pairing.
- The optional workflow-to-client edge is captured by expanding `SUPPORTS` to include `EndUserWorkflow` sources and client targets (`schema/relationships.yaml:122`).

## Governance & Validator Compatibility
- `python3 tools/validator.py --schema` passes with the updated schema artifacts.
- Running `python3 tools/validator.py --schema --data` still fails because PyYAML is unavailable in the current environment; network-restricted pip installs prevented remediation. The schema portion therefore validates, while data checks remain pending external dependency installation.
- Provenance attributes (`source_system`, `jira_reference`, `release_reference`) are now explicitly captured on every definition, matching the documented defaults (`schema/node_types.yaml:9`).

## Dual-Plane Readiness
- Sunny can query all required read-only labels/relationships with the updated context files; Luna receives write-governed metadata for every type via the new provenance fields.
- The `category` field mirrors Product, PlatformArchitecture, and SharedCRM planes, enabling automated plane-to-category auditing.
- ImplementationVariant adds the authoring-plane hook Luna needs to manage client-specific deployments via `CONFIGURED_FOR` and `GOVERNS`.

## Follow-Up TODOs
- Install PyYAML (or adjust the validator) so `python3 tools/validator.py --schema --data` can execute successfully in the target environment.
- Review usage/governance maturity values for SharedCRM nodes (currently many are `planned` per CSV) and update when production readiness improves.
- Populate data artifacts (`data/infra.yaml`, etc.) with ImplementationVariant or new relationship instances as they become available so validator data checks can evolve alongside the schema.
