# Rimidi Knowledge Graph

The Rimidi Knowledge Graph (KG) is the single source of truth for how product capabilities, clinical workflows, and supporting integrations connect. It helps product managers, engineers, and compliance teams reason about change impact, answer traceability questions, and power AI-driven insights.

## Getting Started
1. Review the schema definitions under `schema/` to understand supported node types and relationships.
2. Load the starter dataset from `data/seed.cypher` into your Neo4j environment.
3. Explore curated queries in `queries/` or run ad-hoc Cypher using the examples in `ai/examples.md`.

For contribution guidelines and workflow examples, check `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/playbook.md`.
