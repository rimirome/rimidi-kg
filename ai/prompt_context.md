# Rimidi Knowledge Graph Agent Context

The Rimidi KG automations now rely on three modular agents orchestrated in n8n:
- **Skye** (`ai/prompts/base_prompt_lexi.md`) normalizes teammate language using `data/aliases.yaml` so downstream prompts receive canonical labels and relationships.
- **Sunny** (`ai/prompts/base_prompt_sunny.md`) generates safe, parameterized Cypher backed by the focused context packs in `ai/context/*.md`.
- **Luna** (`ai/prompts/base_prompt_luna.md`) interprets query outputs, connects them to documentation, and recommends next steps without executing Cypher.

Supporting assets include:
- **Context packs** (`ai/context/*.md`) that scope Sunny/Luna to Product, Platform Architecture, or Shared/CRM subgraphs.
- **Loader guidance** (`ai/context_loader_instructions.md` and `tools/load_context.py`) showing how n8n assembles prompts and propagates Skyeâ€™s alias results.

Refer to these files before updating prompt content or wiring automations. The ontology, schema, and validator remain the single source of truth:
- `docs/ontology.md`
- `schema/node_types.yaml`
- `schema/relationships.yaml`
- `schema/attributes.yaml`
- Validator command: `python tools/validator.py --schema --data`

Sunny responses stay consistent: intent summary, validation checklist, Cypher block, and optional hand-off notes for Luna. Luna references documentation sources, while Skye logs which aliases were applied so analysts can trace transformations.
