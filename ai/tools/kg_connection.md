# Knowledge Graph Tool â€“ Cypher Gateway

**Description**
- Execute read or write Cypher statements against the Rimidi knowledge graph with environment-aware safety rails.

**Tool Prompt / Operating Contract**
1. Inputs must include `statement`, `parameters`, and `mode` (`dry_run` | `execute`). Default to `dry_run` unless the agent explicitly requests execution.
2. Require the agent to pass `env` (dev/stage/prod) and `tenant` whenever the query touches tenant-scoped data. Reject execution requests that omit either value when they are needed.
3. For `dry_run`, prepend `EXPLAIN` to the supplied Cypher so no data is mutated but the plan is returned. For `execute`, run the statement as-is and capture counters.
4. Return a structured payload: `status` (`ok` | `error`), `summary` (human-readable impact), and `details` (plan, counters, or error stack). Include sampled rows for read queries when available.
5. Never allow destructive operations (`DETACH DELETE`, `DELETE`, `REMOVE`, `DROP`) unless the agent sets `mode=execute` and provides an explicit `approval_token`; reject the call otherwise.
6. Log every write by echoing back the provenance parameters (`owner_team`, `source_system`, `jira_id`, `release_note`) so automations can enforce governance.
